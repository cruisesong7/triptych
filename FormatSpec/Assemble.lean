# Assembling the bundled spec

The `format_spec` command emits the *ingredients* — the grammar, the constraint list,
and the value expression. This module bundles them into the named predicates of the
design-note contract (§16.1):

* `isWf`                — grammar well-formedness ∧ the string-only (`wfPart`) constraints
* `satisfiesConstraints` — the value-dependent (`valPart`) constraints

The generated spec bundles these two as `isValid := isWf ∧ satisfiesConstraints` (⟺ the
parser accepts the string); see `Emit.lean`.

Both are phrased against the capture environment produced by `decode`. Constraints
of a not-well-formed string are vacuously satisfied (`decode` fails ⟹ no env ⟹ the
constraint list is checked against the empty environment, matching "constraints only
constrain well-formed strings").

Note: these use `decode` (executable, `partial`) for the environment, so they are
definitions for *running*/bundling, not yet the proof-facing forms. The proof-facing
`IsWf` lives in `Denote`; relating the two is part of the contract-theorem milestone.

    is absent (an omitted optional) or `s` is not well-formed. This is the READABLE
    component reader the generated surface `SatisfiesConstraints` uses, so the spec never
    mentions the internal `Env`/`Option`/`getD` plumbing: `component g s "Integer"` instead
    of `(envOf g s "Integer").getD ""`. Definitionally the latter, so no proof gap. -/

/-! ## Contract obligations

The statements of the parser-correctness theorems (design note §16.1). They relate an
*external, hand-written* parser `parse : String → Option α` to the generated spec, via a
projection `π : α → Int` that reads the parsed value's `Int` denotation back out (for a
scalar type `α`; e.g. a `Decimal` projects to its stored `Int`).

**Stated over the SURFACE spec** (not the engine bundle): the acceptance predicate is
passed as an abstract `accepted : String → Prop` and the value function as
`value : String → Option Int`. The generated command instantiates these with the READABLE
`<Name>.IsValid` and `<Name>.computeValue` — so the human-facing contract says exactly
"the real parser accepts iff the readable spec is valid, with matching value". The proof is
still discharged operationally by bridging the surface `IsValid` to `decode` via
`<Name>.IsWf_equiv` (the surface `SatisfiesConstraints` is already decode-based); i.e. the
statement is surface-level, the proof drops to the engine where it is tractable.

These are the theorem *statements* the command emits as `sorry`d obligations — the
proof-facing deliverable. They are parameterized over arbitrary `accepted`/`value`/`parse`/
`π`, so there is nothing to prove generically (the content is per-parser).

The value denotation type `β` is arbitrary (not just `Int`): `val : String → Option β` and
the projection `π : α → β` read the parser's value into that same type. For a scalar format
`β = Int` (the parser's `α` projects to its stored `Int`); for a structured format `β` is the
structured value itself (`SimpleGraph`, adjacency matrix, `IPNet`), often with `α = β` and
`π = id`. -/

variable {α β : Type}

/-- Soundness: if the external `parse` accepts `s` as `a`, then `s` is accepted by the
    (surface) spec and the parsed value's projection equals the spec's value. -/
def SoundStmt (accepted : String → Prop) (val : String → Option β)
    (parse : String → Option α) (π : α → β) : Prop :=
  ∀ s a, parse s = some a → accepted s ∧ val s = some (π a)

/-- Completeness (target-parametrized, matching Cedar's `parse_complete`): if `s` is accepted
    by the (surface) spec and its value equals the projection of a given `a`, then `parse`
    accepts `s` as exactly that `a`. (Cedar phrases the hypothesis with grammar-wf only,
    because its value is `Int64` so the range is implied by `val s = π a`; here `val` is
    arbitrary-precision — range is a separate constraint — so the hypothesis is the full
    `accepted`.) -/
def CompleteStmt (accepted : String → Prop) (val : String → Option β)
    (parse : String → Option α) (π : α → β) : Prop :=
  ∀ s a, accepted s → val s = some (π a) → parse s = some a

/-- Failure characterization: `parse` rejects exactly the strings the (surface) spec does
    not accept. -/
def RejectStmt (accepted : String → Prop) (parse : String → Option α) : Prop :=
  ∀ s, parse s = none ↔ ¬ accepted s

/-! ## The generated correct-by-construction parser

Unlike the `sorry`'d contracts above (which relate an *external* hand-written parser to the
spec), the tool can emit its OWN parser — `computeValue` gated on the decidable acceptance
predicate — and DISCHARGE its three contracts for free. So every generated spec ships a real
verified parser, not just an obligation surface. `gatedParse` yields the value exactly when
the string is accepted; with `π = id` the three `*Stmt`s become the lemmas below, whose only
per-spec input is `hsome` (accepted ⟹ value present), itself uniform (see `Syntax.lean`). -/

/-- The tool's own parser: yield the value exactly when `accepted` holds. -/

/-! ## The lifted generated parser: output the value type `δ`, not the spec's `Int`

The spec value type `β` (e.g. the fixed-point `Int`) is convenient for the affine value-DSL and
the overflow constraint, but a real parser should return the domain type `δ` (e.g. `Decimal`).
The user supplies a *lift* `σ : β → δ` (e.g. `Int64.ofInt`), a section of the external parser's
projection `π : δ → β` (`Int64.toInt`); the generated parser post-composes it:
`gatedParseLift = (gatedParse …).map σ`, yielding an `Option δ` identical in TYPE to the external
parser. Its three contracts are the σ-VIEW analogues — stated with `(val s).map σ` in place of
`val s` — which are exactly what `.map σ`-ing `gatedParse`'s contracts gives, with NO `π` and NO
range side-condition (so `lift` also works standalone, without any external parser). -/

/-! ## The printer side: `toString` roundtrip / injectivity / normalization (δ-view)

The user supplies ONE canonical serializer `toStr : δ → String` over the DOMAIN type `δ` (e.g.
Cedar's `ToString Decimal`); a serializer can't be synthesized — the canonical form is a choice.
BOTH parsers return `Option δ`, so this single serializer drives the printer theorems for both,
stated in the clean δ-VIEW `parse (toStr d) = some d` (matching Cedar's `parse_toString_roundtrip`
exactly). Roundtrip is derived from the parser's `complete` (as Cedar does), given two encode
obligations phrased through the parser's own projection `π` (`accepted (toStr d)` and
`val (toStr d) = some (π d)`); injectivity and normalization then follow generically from the
roundtrip alone. -/

/-- Obligation 1: the serialized form of any domain value is accepted by the spec. -/
def EncodeAcceptedStmt (accepted : String → Prop) (toStr : δ → String) : Prop :=
  ∀ d, accepted (toStr d)

/-- Obligation 2 (π-view): serialize-then-evaluate recovers the value's projection
    (`val (toStr d) = some (π d)`). For the generated parser `π` is `σ`'s left inverse composed

/-- δ-view roundtrip for an EXTERNAL parser: parsing a serialized `d` recovers `d`
