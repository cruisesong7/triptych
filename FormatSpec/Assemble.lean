# Assembling the bundled spec

The `format_spec` command emits the *ingredients* — the grammar, the constraint list,
and the value expression. This module bundles them into the named predicates of the
design-note contract (§16.1):

* `isWf`                — grammar well-formedness ∧ the string-only (`wfPart`) constraints
* `satisfiesConstraints` — the value-dependent (`valPart`) constraints

The generated spec bundles these two as `isValid := isWf ∧ satisfiesConstraints` (⟺ the
parser accepts the string); see `Emit.lean`.

Both are phrased against the capture environment produced by `decode`. Constraints
of a not-well-formed string are vacuously satisfied (`decode` fails ⟹ no env ⟹ the
constraint list is checked against the empty environment, matching "constraints only
constrain well-formed strings").

Note: these use `decode` (executable, `partial`) for the environment, so they are
definitions for *running*/bundling, not yet the proof-facing forms. The proof-facing
`IsWf` lives in `Denote`; relating the two is part of the contract-theorem milestone.

namespace FormatSpec

/-- The capture environment `decode` assigns to `s` (empty if not well-formed). -/
def envOf (g : Grammar) (s : String) : Env :=
  match decode g s with
  | some m => m.toEnv
  | none   => fun _ => none

/-- The matched substring of capture `c` in `s`, as a plain `String` — `""` if the capture
    is absent (an omitted optional) or `s` is not well-formed. This is the READABLE
    component reader the generated surface `SatisfiesConstraints` uses, so the spec never
    mentions the internal `Env`/`Option`/`getD` plumbing: `component g s "Integer"` instead
    of `(envOf g s "Integer").getD ""`. Definitionally the latter, so no proof gap. -/
def component (g : Grammar) (s : String) (c : String) : String := (envOf g s c).getD ""

/-- Well-formedness: the grammar recognizes `s` AND every string-only constraint
    (`wfPart`) holds on its capture environment. -/
def isWf (g : Grammar) (cs : List ConstraintEntry) (s : String) : Prop :=
  (decode g s).isSome = true ∧ ∀ c ∈ cs, c.wfPart (envOf g s)

/-! ## Contract obligations

The statements of the parser-correctness theorems (design note §16.1). They relate an
*external, hand-written* parser `parse : String → Option α` to the generated spec, via a
projection `π : α → Int` that reads the parsed value's `Int` denotation back out (for a
scalar type `α`; e.g. a `Decimal` projects to its stored `Int`).

**Stated over the SURFACE spec** (not the engine bundle): the acceptance predicate is
passed as an abstract `accepted : String → Prop` and the value function as
`value : String → Option Int`. The generated command instantiates these with the READABLE
`<Name>.IsValid` and `<Name>.computeValue` — so the human-facing contract says exactly
"the real parser accepts iff the readable spec is valid, with matching value". The proof is
still discharged operationally by bridging the surface `IsValid` to `decode` via
`<Name>.IsWf_equiv` (the surface `SatisfiesConstraints` is already decode-based); i.e. the
statement is surface-level, the proof drops to the engine where it is tractable.

These are the theorem *statements* the command emits as `sorry`d obligations — the
proof-facing deliverable. They are parameterized over arbitrary `accepted`/`value`/`parse`/
`π`, so there is nothing to prove generically (the content is per-parser).

The value denotation type `β` is arbitrary (not just `Int`): `val : String → Option β` and
the projection `π : α → β` read the parser's value into that same type. For a scalar format
`β = Int` (the parser's `α` projects to its stored `Int`); for a structured format `β` is the
structured value itself (`SimpleGraph`, adjacency matrix, `IPNet`), often with `α = β` and
`π = id`. -/

variable {α β : Type}

/-- Soundness: if the external `parse` accepts `s` as `a`, then `s` is accepted by the
    (surface) spec and the parsed value's projection equals the spec's value. -/
def SoundStmt (accepted : String → Prop) (val : String → Option β)
    (parse : String → Option α) (π : α → β) : Prop :=
  ∀ s a, parse s = some a → accepted s ∧ val s = some (π a)

/-- Completeness: if `s` is accepted by the (surface) spec with value `v`, then `parse`
    accepts it as some `a` whose projection is `v`. -/
def CompleteStmt (accepted : String → Prop) (val : String → Option β)
    (parse : String → Option α) (π : α → β) : Prop :=
  ∀ s v, accepted s → val s = some v →
    ∃ a, parse s = some a ∧ π a = v

/-- Failure characterization: `parse` rejects exactly the strings the (surface) spec does
    not accept. -/
def RejectStmt (accepted : String → Prop) (parse : String → Option α) : Prop :=
  ∀ s, parse s = none ↔ ¬ accepted s
